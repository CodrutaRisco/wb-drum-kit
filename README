# Drum Kit Project 🥁

This project was built by following Wes Bos's **JavaScript 30** course.  
It simulates a virtual drum set that can be played using your keyboard.

## 🔥 What it does

- When you press certain keys on the keyboard (e.g., A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L),  
a drum sound plays and a visual animation is triggered on screen.

## 💻 Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 🚀 How to run locally

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate into the project directory:


3. Open `index.html` in your browser (control+click it and Open with live server).


## 📚 What I learned

- DOM element selection
- Handling events (`keydown`, `transitionend`)
- Adding/removing CSS classes with JavaScript
- Playing audio files in the browser
